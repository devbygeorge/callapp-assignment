# CallApp Assignment

This repository contains the source code for a CRUD application built using Node.js, Express, and React, along with a database file. 

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the `backend` and `frontend` directories in separate terminal windows. In each directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server for both the backend and frontend applications.

```
git clone https://github.com/devbygeorge/callapp-assignment.git
cd callapp-assignment/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used

- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- Axios
- Ant Design
- Zustand

## Features
The front end of the application uses Ant Design components such as a table, pie chart, modal, and form to display and interact with data from the backend. The application uses the Zustand library to manage state, specifically to fetch and display person data in the table, add, edit, or remove persons.
